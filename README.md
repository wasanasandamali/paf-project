#### Brief Description of your Solution - Our team has been hired to create the "Foodie" social networking platform for foodies. By 
making, updating, and removing posts that include photographs and descriptions, users of the 
site will be able to share their experiences with food and dining. Users can also browse each 
other's profiles, follow each other, and like and comment on each other's postings. OAuth2-
based authentication will be used to secure the entire platform.
To do this, we will create a client web application using React and a REST API using Java Spring 
Boot. A user-friendly and intuitive interface will be used by users to create posts and respond to 
other users' postings. Additionally, the site will provide notifications for significant occurrences 
like new followers or comments.
The overall objective is to provide a user-friendly and secure platform that develops a community 
of food enthusiasts who can communicate about their eating experiences
